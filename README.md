# Getting Started with a Nuxt 4 Website

Welcome to your journey into web development with **Nuxt 4**! This guide is written for total beginners—no experience required. Follow the steps below to set up your environment, understand key concepts, and contribute confidently to a Nuxt website.

## 1. What is Nuxt?

Nuxt is a powerful framework for building modern websites and applications using Vue.js, with features like fast development, automatic routing, and built-in server-side rendering. Learn more:
https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction

## 2. Step-by-Step Setup

### a. Install a Code Editor

You'll write code using a program called a "code editor."

- **Recommended:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code): https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Quick Start with VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics


### b. Install Node.js (and npm)

Nuxt runs on Node.js, a platform for running JavaScript on your computer.

- Download Node.js (it includes npm): https://nodejs.org/
- Check installation:
Open your terminal and type:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

You should see version numbers.


### c. Get Git

Git helps you download ("clone") the code and contribute your changes.

- Download Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Beginner-friendly intro: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git


## 3. Download (Clone) the Project

You'll need the link to the project repository (ask your team if you don't have it).

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

- How to clone: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository


## 4. Install Project Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```


## 5. Start the Development Server

To see your website locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the site.

## 6. Explore \& Edit the Project

- Edit files in your code editor.
- Most project files are in the `pages/`, `components/`, and `app.vue`.

Nuxt saves your changes automatically and refreshes the website ("Hot Module Replacement").

## 7. Build for Production

Ready to prepare your site for the real world (deployment)? Build it with:

```bash
npm run build
```


---

## 8. Preview the Production Build

After building, preview your site locally to be sure it works:

```bash
npm run preview
```


## 9. Deploy (Optional Advanced Step)

To publish your site on the Internet, follow Nuxt's deployment guide:
https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment

git push
```

## 13. Common Issues? Try These

- Run each command in your project folder.
- If `npm install` fails, try deleting `node_modules` and running it again.
- If your browser isn’t updating, stop and restart the dev server.
